The moonlight was still there, on the dashboard, though the driver's side window was broken 
and my wife's purse was gone

The thief, what else did he take? 

Perhaps the childhood of someone
who wasn't raised well, a young man 
without the good fortune to receive guidance or to be helped with
his homework or to be directed towards school

Perhaps the thief took the love too that this young man was meant to receive. 

I think of Hank and Jodi with grandchild who has leukemia.

We drive home with the heat on. 
The air at night in winter is cold.

What is a purse,
what is a broken window,
when compared to these things?
